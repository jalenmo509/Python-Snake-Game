# Python-Snake-Game

The code uses a variety of methods built into the Pygame library, including:

pygame.init() - initializes the Pygame library and checks for errors
pygame.display.set_caption() - sets the title of the game window
pygame.display.set_mode() - creates a new window for the game to run in
pygame.Color() - creates color objects used to draw shapes and text on the screen
pygame.time.Clock() - creates a Pygame clock object used to regulate the game's framerate
pygame.font.SysFont() - creates a Pygame font object used to display text on the screen
pygame.event.get() - retrieves a list of Pygame events (such as user input) from the event queue
pygame.draw.rect() - draws a rectangle shape on the screen
pygame.display.update() - updates the game window with any changes made to the screen
pygame.quit() - quits the Pygame library and closes the game window
sys.exit() - exits the Python interpreter
In addition to these Pygame-specific methods, the code also uses built-in Python methods and functions such as import, list(), str(), ord(), and random.randrange().
